Human Risk Management and Security Awareness Portfolio
This repository houses examples of work I have done around Security Awareness and Human Risk Management. 

None of these materials may be reused for any purpose, as they are listed here for informational purposes.

Materials here may include clips of training modules I have developed, watermarked infographics or examples of phishing simulations, metrics definitions & KPIs, strategies and other work pertaining to a human risk management program.
